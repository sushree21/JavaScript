<!-- 14.Even numbers are divisible by 2 and the remainder is zero. How do you check, if a number is even or not using JavaScript? Create a program which checks that the given number is even or odd.
    In javascript we use prompt to take user input and then take if else condition to know weather the input number is divisible by 2 or not.if it divisible by 2 then it is a even number otherwise it is a odd number. -->
